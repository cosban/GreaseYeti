This fork of GreaseYETI (updated from the 2.23 source by headbanger at [xatal.com](xatal.com)) introduces a much requested feature... an ignorator which can do the following:

- Hide posts and topics from annoying users
- Automatically update to ignore users if they change their username
- Hide portions of posts which quote ignorated users

## Important Notes
- This is a long script that does a bunch of shit. It's going to be buggy, but if you let me know in this topic or over PM about some problems, I can try to help you fix them and release bug fixed versions.
- If you're using Chrome, you'll need Tampermonkey. No idea how this works in Opera/IE/Safari. Tampermonkey: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en
- Let me know if there are other features you'd like me to add.
